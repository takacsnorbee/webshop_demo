## Live Mini React JS exam: 60 mins

```js
// Live Mini React JS exam: 60 mins

// 1. Write a "render counter" functional component:
// - Only 1 component is enough
// - "Click me for triggering a render" button: onClick: do a state change in the comp. (no UI req. for this)
// - Show a value on the UI that indicates the number of renders of the component (on click a new render happens)
// - You should count NOT the number of the button clicks but truly the number of renders!

// 2. Compare props and component local state (read-only, immutability, etc.)!

// 3. What are the features of React? Say at least 3!
// Hint: https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/reactjs-tutorial/reactjs-interview-questions

// 4. Why is there a need for using keys in Lists?

// 5. How to transform a class component into a functional one? Steps?

// 6. For state update why to use the state setter, why can we not set the value directly?

// 7. Which 3 lifecycle methods (class based comps.) can be implemented by the useEffect hook?

// 8. Compare useState and useRef (which triggers re-render)!

// 9. When to use Redux? How it works?

// 10. Mention some middlewares! What are their roles?

// 11. When React.memo is useful? How can help the useCallback and useMemo its working?

// 12. What triggers re-renders in React? Hint: https://www.developerway.com/posts/react-re-renders-guide
